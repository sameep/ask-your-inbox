## What is This?

Your email inbox is a treasure trove of information, but finding anything specific can be a nightmare. Traditional search is often clunky and relies on exact keywords.

**Ask Your Inbox** transforms your email archive into a conversational assistant. It uses powerful AI models to understand the *meaning* and *context* behind your questions, allowing you to find information, summarize conversations, and uncover insights you never thought possible.

This application runs locally on your machine, ensuring your emails remain private.

---

## Features

- **Natural Language Chat**: Ask questions like you would talk to a person, e.g., *"What were the main takeaways from the project alpha meeting last month?"*
- **Advanced Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic (meaning-based) search with keyword, sender, and date filters for highly accurate results.
- **Conversation Thread Analysis**: Understands reply-chains to find relevant context, even if it's buried in a long thread.
- **Local & Private**: Your MBOX email file is processed directly on your computer and is never uploaded to a server.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple web interface powered by Streamlit makes the entire process easy and intuitive.
- **Fast Caching**: After the first processing, your data is saved locally for near-instant re-loading.

---

## How It Works

The app uses a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline to give you the best answers:

1.  **Ingest & Sanitize**: It reads your MBOX file, cleans up the data, and parses it into a structured format.
2.  **Embed**: It uses **Voyage AI** to create numerical representations (embeddings) of your emails based on their meaning.
3.  **Search & Re-rank**: When you ask a question, it filters emails by sender/date, finds the most semantically relevant candidates, and then re-ranks them based on recency, keywords, and conversation context.
4.  **Synthesize**: It sends the most relevant email snippets to **Claude AI** to generate a clear, human-readable summary that directly answers your question.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

1.  **Python 3.8 or newer**: If you don't have Python, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.
2.  **API Keys**: You'll need keys from two services to power the AI.
    -   A **Claude AI** API Key for generating answers.
    -   A **Voyage AI** API Key for semantic search.
3.  **An MBOX File**: An archive of your emails.

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

Follow these steps carefully to get the application running.

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys

You need to sign up for two services. Both offer free starting credits that are more than enough to get started.

#### Claude AI (by Anthropic)

1.  Go to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign up.
2.  Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your account settings.
3.  Create a new API key and copy it immediately. **You will not be able to see it again!**

#### Voyage AI

1.  Go to the [Voyage AI Dashboard](https://dash.voyageai.com/) and sign up.
2.  Navigate to the **API Keys** section from the left-hand menu.
3.  Your default API key will be visible there. Copy it.

**Keep these two keys safe and ready for a later step.**

### Step 2: Get Your MBOX Email Archive

You need to export your emails into a single `.mbox` file. Here's how to do it for common services:

-   **Gmail**: Use [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).
    1.  Click "Deselect all".
    2.  Scroll down and select "Mail".
    3.  Choose the option to include all mail or select specific labels.
    4.  Proceed to export. You will receive a link to download a `.zip` file containing your `.mbox` file.
-   **Apple Mail / Thunderbird**: These clients often store emails in MBOX format natively or have a simple export option. Look for an "Export Mailbox" feature.

Save this `.mbox` file somewhere you can easily find it.

### Step 3: Set Up the Application

Now we'll set up the code on your computer. Open your terminal or command prompt to run these commands.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    This downloads the code to your machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ask-your-inbox.git
    cd ask-your-inbox
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/ask-your-inbox` with the actual URL of the repository)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    This is a best practice that keeps the app's dependencies isolated.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Now, activate it:
    -   On **macOS/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`
    -   On **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.  **Install Required Packages**
    This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the necessary Python libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## How to Use the App

You're all set! Now you can run the application.

1.  **Launch the App**
    In your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is still active), run the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    *(Note: The main Python file might have a different name, like `email_chat_app_pro.py`. Use that name if so.)*

2.  **Use the Web Interface**
    Your web browser should automatically open to a new page. If not, your terminal will show you a "Local URL" to visit (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **First-Time Setup in the App:**
    -   In the sidebar on the left, paste your **Voyage AI API Key** and **Claude API Key** into the respective fields and click "Set API Keys".
    -   Click the "Browse files" button to upload your `.mbox` file.
    -   Click the **"Process MBOX File"** button.

4.  **Initial Processing**
    The first time you process a file, the app will analyze and create embeddings for every email. **This may take a while for large archives (several minutes to over an hour).** You will see progress bars for each step.

    The great news is that this is a **one-time process**. The results are cached, so subsequent launches will be lightning-fast.

5.  **Start Chatting!**
    Once processing is complete, the chat interface is ready. Ask anything you want!

    **Example Questions:**
    -   `"Find the flight confirmation email from United last year"`
    -   `"What did Sarah say about the marketing budget in her emails from March?"`
    -   `"Summarize my conversation thread with the new client, Acme Inc."`

## A Note on Privacy

Your privacy is paramount.
-   Your `.mbox` file and the generated cache file **never leave your computer**.
-   The only data sent to an external service is the text from the most relevant emails, which is sent to **Claude AI's API** to generate a summarized answer for your specific query. Your broader email archive remains private.
